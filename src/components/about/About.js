                        The film follows a group
                        of young adults who try to flee from
                        the Soultaker when their souls are
                        ejected from their bodies after a car
                        accident.

                    <Heading subtitle>Philosophy has almost
                    as many definitions as there have been
                    philosophers, both as a subject matter
                    and an activity, and no simple definition
                    can do it justice. The issue of the
                    definition of philosophy is thus a
                    controversial subject that is nowadays
                    tackled by Metaphilosophy (or the philosophy
                    of philosophy).
